			<strong> On Writing </strong>
			<p> Writing this "essay" was probably the most writer's block I've experienced in writing a piece for a Bishop's assignment in a very long time. I found it really challenging to write anything for this project &mdash; there was really no place to start. Starting high on the "tree" was challenging because it meant casting a very wide net, so I'd have to outline those areas first, writing very broadly to ensure that I wouldn't make any argument that would actually be contradicted by another argument on a lower level of the tree. Starting low was also challenging &mdash; if I hadn't written the branches above the leaf, I wouldn't know what had been said, what hadn't, and what tone to take on for writing. This meant that each essay chunk was a laborious crawl to write. I first planned out the tree structure, and then I got to writing, and while I had vague ideas flying around as to what I would write where, the tree required an obscene amount of segmentation. I couldn't reference ideas from the other side of the tree in any node, and I couldn't go too far or too short in arguing or I'd risk making a node redundant or self-contradictory. I guess I could say this taught me a lot about my writing style &mdash; I do well with flexibility. I often write outlines for myself, but I take the path of least resistance, and that often means writing things out of order or making things up on the fly. In this environment, both of those cop-outs were impossible, making for a grueling writing process. </p>
			<strong> On the Essay </strong>
			<p> The ever cliched claim that an essay is a "try" was very much apparent here. Each essay "tried" to make an argument, but in the end, some did it much better than others. The structure of the project is somewhat to blame for this; other culprits might be my workload in other classes and the difficulty of properly revising such a sprawling piece. The cohesiveness of an essay is also brought into question &mdash; I typically put a lot of thought into the start and end of an essay, but here, my start was nondescript (anything more and I'd cut off entire branches of "essays") and my conclusions were multiple. The lengths of each piece vary, and some nodes feed into the same nodes on lower levels. </p>
			<strong> On the College Process </strong>
			<p> I've always known that stereotyping college applicants and colleges was a pretty silly thing to do, but this exercise in silliness really highlighted that. Even among the stereotypes that I was making, I knew that there was so much more depth and nuance of stereotype (!) that I could've gotten into &mdash; what specific type of party school might a student be attending? What's the difference between a public in-state school in California and South Dakota? And what about the different types of students within each school? Beyond this, there were so many other arguments and lines of thought that (for practicality's sake) I could not pursue. I guess the conclusion is that the college process is inherently multifaceted, complex, and unique for everyone, but the obviousness of that idea makes for a pretty lackluster senior year conclusion... </p>
			<strong> Other Notes </strong>
			<p> Some formatting was not possible from my code base &mdash; <i> Das Kapital </i> should probably be italicized, as with a number of other words for emphasis; the words resume and cliche are missing their ever-so-dear accents. One of the most frustrating parts of writing the essay was actually formatting it in VSCode: the em dash became "\u2014", every quotation mark had to be fixed and replaced with an HTML-friendly character, and emojis required digging for a unique Unicode hex code and writing it in with an escape. </p>
			<strong> Book of Interest </strong>
			<p> One of the things that took time away from me completing this project was reading for pleasure &mdash; I'm currently reading Heinz Insu Fenkl's translation of Kim Man-jung's <i> The Nine Cloud Dream</i>, which is considered one of Korea's most important fictional works. The book takes on a number of ideas I don't see often, like the syncretism of Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism or thickly-veiled criticism of King Sukjong of Joseon, but also a number of ideas that made me feel like this piece would do fine in Advanced Honors English! (The story centers a prodigious genius and functions as seventeenth-century metafiction.) </p>
